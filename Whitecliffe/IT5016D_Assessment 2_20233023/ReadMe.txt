there is two classes in this program, class Ticket and class Main
class Ticket is that class that has the template for the tickets and also is where the stats for all the tickets are created. I made it so most of the functions that are needed happened in the Ticket class.
class Main is the class where mostly everything is activated. it is also where all the inputs are and mainly so that the program can be actvated from a single line.
